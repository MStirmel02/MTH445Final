        "This agents based weather model was built using NetLogo which modeled weather patterns of an island with varying landforms from planes to mountains to simulate real island geography. In order to asure a realistic model, many factors were taken into account such as the humidity, elevation, time of day, season, solar intensity, temperature, pressure, ocean and wind currents, and soil moisture to name a few. To begin, we'll start by defining the geography of the island in which the simulation will take place. To do this, we built rectangular regions with differing elevation regions to demonstrate the effect of elevation on cloud cover. Two examples of these rectangular regions are demonstrated below.\n",
